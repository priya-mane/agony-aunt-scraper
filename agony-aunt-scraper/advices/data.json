", "I think you\u2019ve already seen the pitfalls of trying to actualise a fantasy; what is exciting and satisfying in fantasy, where you have total control over what happens, can be less so in reality, where everyone else has their own input and agenda and reaction and need. Some couples are happy to keep her own dreams strictly to themselves. Some like to talk their fantasies over and playact fulfilling them. And yes, some do go that extra mile and do them for real. And I am sure there are some people who manage this very well and are happy with it. But I\u2019m equally sure there is frequently an imbalance with one partner loving it and the other only going along to keep their partner happy. If you want to consider this further I\u2019d suggest you have a look at one of my books on sexual fantasies \u2013 click on \u201cBooks\u201d on the right \u2013 and follow the tips I give for being safe rather than sorry. ", "But let\u2019s put aside the question of whether you should ask her to act out your fantasy of three in a bed. Surely the big issue is that after many years of knowing her and two years of marriage, you seem to be saying that the two of you have difficulty in communicating properly about sex. Before you run you need to walk and before you negotiate three in a bed surely you need to address feeling comfortable and secure in talking about the basic aspects of your sex life \u2013 does it fulfil you both, can you talk about what you want and need, or don\u2019t want and don\u2019t need. ", "So start talking \u2013 not about fantasies but about the reality; what you like about your sex life with her. Encourage her to feel safe and secure in sharing what she likes, and then both of you can talk over what you\u2019d like to do to satisfy each other in the future. If you\u2019d like a bit of support in this, consider seeing a Relate therapist. Not because there is anything wrong, but to help you fine tune your relationship so I doesn\u2019t become distant or difficult. When you can be open and honest about the basics, you can move on to the frills. Good luck!"]},

When I got to be about 7 I started putting on weight, my mothers habits within feeding me & my sister caused us to both grow to unhealthy weights. My mother isn\u2019t all to blame though, because I gained my own independence as far as eating habits were concerned. I was unaware of consequences. Although the severe bullying at school & the taunting from my uncaring abusive father made me feel horrible & led me to understand that I was \u2018fat\u2019. But my lack of education in that region led me to believe that there was nothing I could do about it & that was just the way my life was going to be. I learnt to tolerate the bullying. When I reached secondary school I began to learn exactly how what I was eating & how I was treating my body physically was affecting me. Although the bullying reduced as I mixed with a lrager range of students, it still went on. I tried diets & other such ways to lose weight. But my love for food & my honest desire to enjoy the way I was pushed me to lose the will power. I began to be able to tolerate the moments of emotion pain when I noticed how I looked or when others taunted me. I could cope with those moments in small doses, but could not cope with the lack of food & the unwanted exercise activities. More recently I tried the gym, back when I had the confidence to try those things. I lost weight, which soon piled back on due to my lack of will power again. I begain self harming, lying & smoking to ease my pain. Lying about the things I wanted to be true. Saying things to make me the centre of attention, good or bad. I want to be thin & on some random occassions I will feel something inside me which tells me that I can do it. No matter what people say to me I cannot gain enough power. My health is bad & my immune system is against me. I have no confidence to go to gyms or go swimming or take part in other sports. I cannot be pushed with phrases or do good comments.

When i bacame pregnant we have only been together 4months but since we both wanted a child and were happy together we decided that i should move into his home and live life as family.he is Italian and we live in Italy where his family live 50 km away and i\u2019m from england and don\u2019t have family here but many friends after living here 7 years. the problem is his life hasn\u2019t changed as much as mine . He still has his hobbies , and complains when he doesn\u2019t find time to carry them out and he insists on going every week to his parents for sunday lunch. Whilst i accept this I wish he would acccept that it isnt my custom to go every Sunday and maybe once in a while i\u2019d like to cook at home or see friends on Sunday instead of having this obligation which i\u2019m beginning to resent however nice his family are. When my mum comes out he complains we have no privacy but when we have time to do thing s together he tells me not to disturb him as he has a film to watch or a book to read.  Sometime i feel overwhelmed by his family and feel he has had a child to satisfy his parents. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a doll to be paraded on Sundays. i would like to put my foot down and refuse to go on Sunday since we have been there twice already this week and the drive is tiring too, but i don\u2019t want to argue for the sake of the baby. i feel down because my life hasn\u2019t got any control and i have to do things to satisfy others except myself. any advice on how to handle this ??????????

Abusers often force one young child to abuse another so the abuse can be by proxy and they can claim, or persuade themselves, they were innocent. The child who does the action is as much a victim and feels as violated as the child acted upon. ", "Whatever happened, the fact of the matter is your daughter felt at risk and vulnerable. She felt something happened. And what was the reaction? To call her a liar, to send her to live with the man she had said abused her. A man who subsequently rejected the boy in question, and who has now rejected her. ", "If there is a degree of anger, guilt, loss sloshing around I wouldn\u2019t be in the least surprised. She was let down most frightfully by you, her brother, (as he was by ihs father, too) her father, and now is being let down by her stepfather. No wonder she wants to leave home. I\u2019d suggest it is time to talk with her about what happened \u2013 to listen and believe and accept her feelings of rage, helplessness, betrayal. Hurtful and tough for a mother to take on board but isn\u2019t it about time? And while you\u2019re about it, it would be worth while getting in touch with him and offering to listen to him, too.

I resigned myself to be mother/father and handy-man years ago but my seven year old daughter is starting to get upset with him never playing with her or doing things for her.  She got a swing-set for her birthday three months ago.  I tried to put it up myself but couldn\u2019t.  She asks him on a daily basis to put it up for her but it\u2019s still lying on the grass.  Am I being unreasonable considering he works so hard, doesn\u2019t have a temper, and rarely drinks?  "], "advice": ["So he\u2019s out all day at work, doesn\u2019t shout at or hit you or your daughter and doesn\u2019t piss away his earnings. That qualifies him in being a Good Man? I beg to differ. Let me tell you what is the commonest causes of personal, relationship and marital difficulty; it\u2019s encapsulated in one statement, so often spoken through tears or gritted teeth; \u201cMy father was never there for me\u201d.", "When your father shows you that work or friends are more important to him than you, it leaves children with a life long conviction that they don\u2019t matter, that they have no value. It leads to crippling loss of self esteem, lack of confidence, lack of self worth. It leads to children growing up to be adults who gravitate to bad relationships often with men who display the same either selfish or dysfunctional behaviour. They fall into such a relationship because they feel they aren\u2019t worth better, or because they convince themselves that if they can change him it may be the same as going back in time and making their own Dad love and notice them. I have  suspicion that\u2019s why you\u2019ve fallen for and stick with this man; you had a Dad just like him.", "Well, look at yourself. In spite of your protestations, are you happy with him? A man who thinks work and his mates are more important than his wife and daughter? Who will ignore repeated requests to simply do what any decent person sharing a house would and should do? To do what any decent father would do? I don\u2019t think so. To be frank, the damage he is doing to you and your children is just as bad as if he got drunk and hit you. Subtle abuse by lack of love and attention is actually as harmful as out and out violence \u2013 it just leave scars less noticeable to the untrained eye. ", "So  no, you\u2019re not being unreasonable. He is \u2013 very unreasonable. Criminally so. Just as I suspect you had a Dad very like him, I would imagine he did too, and that\u2019s why he behaves in this way. He hasn\u2019t a good model of how to be a Dad. He\u2019s damaged by his own upbringing and can\u2019t bear to see the enormous pain and hurt he is causing and unable to see the equally enormous payoff he\u2019d get if he did become a caring, sharing father. In many ways I feel terribly sorry for him \u2013 he is missing out on so much. And in many ways I can forgive the initial inability to function as a Dad \u2013 it wasn\u2019t his fault. But while he may not have had a good model of being a father, that excuse only gets you so far. Once you are adult enough to realise what your behaviour is doing \u2013 and he\u2019s had it pointed out to him sufficient times by both you and his daughter \u2013 it becomes his responsibility; no excuses.  ", "What to do? Difficult because unless you\u2019re prepared to demand a change and push it through, unless he is prepared to see and listen and change, you\u2019re stuck. One way would be to emphasise the enormous benefit of being a Dad who is there for his kids. Do you know anyone like that, whose spends time with them and for them and in return is loved by them? If you do, get them to have a word to help your husband see what he is missing and how easy and pleasant it could be to make that change.", "I think your daughter needs to be firmly told it isn\u2019t her fault and Daddy doesn\u2019t ignore her because she deserves it. Don\u2019t protect him from her anger, either. Help her make her request loud and clear, and be able to express her disgust with him. Any child with a family member who acts like this may need extra help with self esteem and self worth issues, and you may like to ask the school or your GP if they have someone she can talk to. ", "One way of dealing with it would be simply to tell him to shape up or ship out. Some Dads do change when they are about to lose their kids, or do so. The damage a separation or divorce may do you and your kids seems to me to be less than the damage continuing to condone and allow his behaviour causes. Or, you could start paying for help around the house and hand him the bills. If he objects, tell him he does it or someone else does; his choice. And don\u2019t wait; make an appointment with a builder or whatever and only cancel it when he completes the job. Often, people who refuse to pull their weight can do so because everyone else adjusts to take up the slack. Stop cooking his meals, washing his coffee cups, cleaning his shirts until he does his share. Bring that swing set in from the garden and leave it on his side of the bed. ", "But most of all I\u2019d make an appointment with a Relate counsellor. Don\u2019t cancel if he refuses to go with you, or if you do decide the only way to deal with this is call it a day.

What matters is that a couple communicate and communication seems to be what is missing here.", "Instead of waiting for mechanical Sunday morning, take the initiative again and do it with the intention of breaking this pattern of silence and grief. Obviously, if you tell him his technique leaves a lot to be desired he\u2019s going to be hurt. But you can show him how to please you with movement and suggestion. He\u2019ll be encouraged to continue when you respond with interest.", "It might help you to know that all female orgasms are clitoral. You can stimulate the clitoris directly, with caresses or by squeezing or brushing this area between your body and his. Or, you can make sure the area is stimulated by movements of his penis in your vagina. If he\u2019s large, this can be quite easy. If he isn\u2019t, you might need to explore and experiment to find what suits you both. Some lovemaking positions are better than others.", "If you want to make sure the clitoris is strongly stimulated, try taking the upper position. You can then direct and time thrusts to make sure they stimulate you. Or, have him on top but shift position so he rides far higher on your body. This means his penis doesn\u2019t penetrate as far, but does press against the clitoris.

She said they have discussed it, but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. I even suggested she tried masturbation, but she screwed up her nose and said she doesn\u2019t feel like it. I told her I never wanted sex until I met my present partner 8 years ago at the age of 46, when I enjoyed it \u2013 and felt like it \u2013 more than ever.  This faded after 4/5 years, so I am back to square one.  He is a sexually-active 64 year old and wishes I was more keen. My daughter is a warm and loving person who is not afraid to show her affection, with no major hang-ups, but with no libido. Are we both frigid??  Is it hereditary?  I believe my mother is the same. "], "advice": ["Freud said that when two people made love, there were always four other people \u2013 our parents \u2013 in the room, at least in spirit. And often, we imagine that they are disgusted and disapproving, which puts a damper on passion to say the least.  Sexual attitudes are hereditary in as much as we learn to be frightened of the power of sexual desire, to see sex as dangerous and ourselves as dirty if we enjoy it, from our family.", "Whether you realise it or not, there seems to be a script in your family history that says sex isn\u2019t something a proper woman should enjoy and lose herself in. However much your conscious  minds might like to enjoy sex, this holds both of you back. Self consciousness and inhibitions can fade with age and self confidence, or when an assured partner can set a more positive tone. But as you\u2019ve found, fears can reassert themselves unless you really deal with them.", "Both of you might benefit from talking with a sexual counsellor or therapist \u2013 from Relate or one attached to your own doctor\u2019s surgery. A therapist would help you explore what holds you back and why, and aid you and your partner in making some changes. But I gently suggest that although open and free discussion between mother and daughter is wonderful and to be encouraged, there are limits. Pass this suggestion on to your daughter and show her that you value the idea by doing it yourself. But leave each other to get on with it, with your own partners. Parents and children can often get into less than helpful competition when it comes to sex.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a total coincidence, for instance, that you found passion  when your daughter was 16 and lost it when she found her own boyfriend, or that her sexual development has been difficult during these years.

My boyfriend  and I agree that his foreskin needs to be pulled back first before putting the condom on. But he always pulls the skin forwards again after the condom is on because he says it gives the skin freedom to move over the head during sex (like having sex without a condom). But when he tries it his way, the condom sometimes comes loose during thrusting and we have to stop and fix it. Although we\u2019re careful, I do get worried about the safety aspect of this. We\u2019ve tried it with the skin back a few times and he said that when we started thrusting it felt like his foreskin was being pulled back too far, so we had to stop. Do other couples keep it skinned back or are we doing something wrong here? Thanks in advance. "], "advice": ["Dear Suzie,", "\n", "Yes, you need to keep the foreskin pulled back, both when you put on the condom and whilst having sex with it on. If you let the foreskin slide forward during sex the condom will slip off and you will risk pregnancy. ", "The correct way to put on a condom is to wait until he is fully erect, but before you have had any contact between his penis and your vagina. Pull the foreskin back, pinch the end of the condom to leave a small airspace at the tip, and unroll it right down to the root of his penis, so it nestles against his body. Keep it fully on him \u2013 if necessary keep it anchored by holding it on. When he has come, he should carefully pull out of you holding the condom in place. Slip it off and tie a knot in the end or wrap it in tissue and then throw it away \u2013 don\u2019t flush it down the loo. Make sure he doesn\u2019t put his penis near your vagina again without washing or wiping himself thoroughly and doesn\u2019t enter you again without putting on a fresh condom. ", "I think the problem here is that he is confusing the sensations he is used to when masturbating with the sensations you\u2019d get when having intercourse. Guys who are uncut often do learn to please themselves by manipulating the foreskin over the glans. It feels better sometimes than using the hand directly on the glans \u2013 his hand can feel too rough. Or, because he\u2019s feeling sensation in both his own hand and the glans, it\u2019s clear to him he\u2019s stimulating himself. It can feel better, and is more lubricated, to make sure the foreskin is the part that does the rubbing. But when you have intercourse, the foreskin will skin back and the sensation then comes from rubbing against the silky soft, grainy inside of the vagina. If he could let himself get used to having his foreskin skinned back, he\u2019d find the sensation is actually far better than pulling the foreskin over the glans. ", "It might help to show him how it could feel by masturbating him with the foreskin pulled back and with plenty of cream slathered over your hand. But if you\u2019re going to put on a condom and have intercourse after, make sure you use lubricating gel or cream from the chemist, or bought via website such as durex.com. Using anything other than lubrication designed for condoms is asking for trouble since the oil in most creams will rot them in seconds. And I mean seconds!", "Sex takes practise to get right and to feel really good. My advice? Plenty of practise! Oh it\u2019s a hard job but somebody\u2019s got to do it\u2026\u2026"]},

Cut through the chatter and the reality is that most men want to be loved and cherished, and most women welcome a good shag. Where the two sexes do vary is in how they experience and express those needs.", "As a whole, men are brought up to eschew the lovey-dovey and touchy-feely. It\u2019s not manly and it certainly isn\u2019t British to go around saying \u201cI lurve you\u201d and hugging, kissing or otherwise showing effete emotion. They are largely encouraged to suppress and repress feelings, instead relying on a complex series of coded behaviour to both have and declare them. Thus, men often use sex as a way of saying \u201cI love you\u201d, to say or show their tender feelings.", "Courting, seducing and shagging gives a context and allows men to show both need and affection. A man who might feel foolish or compromised if he held, caressed or kissed his partner outside the bedchamber, can give free rein to his romantic side if and when it\u2019s in pursuit of the proper, macho goal of nooky. Some will even allow themselves the luxury of letting down their guard enough to make open, verbal declarations of love \u2013 in bed, and nowhere else. But, above all, the act of sex is seen as an act of love \u2013 the most intimate and exposed way of declaring \u201cI love you\u201d that he knows or is often capable of making.  ", "Women, who are far more verbal, don\u2019t see sex in the same light. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s great, it\u2019s even necessary, but it\u2019s just one of many ways to get what everyone needs most of all, which is the sense of being valued and needed. So turning down sex isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a rejection of the person or their love, but a refusal to participate at that particular time in that particular act of arousal. It ain\u2019t, always, personal.", "The problem is that men tend to take it very personally, every time. To be told their sex isn\u2019t required is felt as enormously hurtful. Most men add 2+2 and make 247. They\u2019re convinced their partner thinks they\u2019re dreadful in bed, that\u2019s why she turned them down. Or they suspect she doesn\u2019t love them anymore, that\u2019s why she turned them down. Or she\u2019s frigid, that\u2019s why she turned them down. Or she thinks they\u2019re a pervert, that\u2019s why she turned them down.", "In fact, it\u2019s likely to be none of those. What she may simply feel is that since what you want is an appetite satisfied, it can wait. If she knew how much feeling the man invested in making love, and how hurt they may be at being refused, she may want to come halfway. ", "Of course, sometimes women know exactly what they are doing and what effect it is having when they turn down sex. Perhaps they do feel that there are serious problems in the relationship and \u201cNo Sex\u201d is a way of telling the man that it\u2019s time you sorted out the disagreements. But the message she may want to pass on could be less alarming. Maybe all she is trying to do is draw attention to what she feels she is lacking.", "If his courting methods smack of the jungle \u2013 he roars, thumps his chest and gets down to it with a growl \u2013 no wonder she finds lovemaking less than appealing. To most women, love has to accompany sex. They want to be wooed, not just rogered.

When she confronted me with them, I decided that honesty was the best policy and I told her that I had felt the need to masturbate regularly  since adolescence and that I only wore the women\u2019s knickers during masturbation sessions.", "Unfortunately, she showed no understanding and drew the conclusion  that I was a transvestite and that the reason I have such a large penis was because I masturbated so often. Things got even worse when she started to confide in her friends and they basically told her that I was a weirdo and that she was crazy to put up with the soreness that she sometimes suffered after our more vigorous lovemaking sessions.", "After this she rarely let me penetrate her and often made disparaging remarks about my cock. She even told me that I embarrassed her in front of her friends because they would notice the protrusion in my trousers and tease her by referring to me as The Donkey. Now that I am single again, I find myself masturbating more than ever, sometimes up to four times a day. When my girlfriend said that masturbation had caused my cock to grow abnormally big I dismissed this as nonsense.", "However, I am now starting to wonder if she was right because it has actually grown in length by about a third of an inch since we separated and is now a fraction under ten inches long. I know that there are bigger penises than mine around, but I would be interested to know how common it is to find ones as big as I have.", "Does the fact that I often wear women\u2019s knickers for masturbation mean that I have transvestite tendencies, and would it be wise for me to inform future girlfriends about my habits in order to avoid the scenario that led to the break-up of my relationship with my last girlfriend? With regard to my tendency to get erections in public places, do I run the risk of persecution for indecent behaviour?", "Having a penis that\u2019s just over six inches long when relaxed as well as large testicles means that most trousers are unable to hide the outline of my genitals and I have noticed that people\u2019s glances are often drawn to my crotch area. Several times now I have found myself standing on a crowded  tube train with women seated just in front of me and then it felt my penis getting a full erection with little means for me to conceal it.", "Now, you see you went one step too far in this fantasy and spoiled it. I might \u2013 just might \u2013 have believed you had a ten inch dong. Very, very unlikely as the average is 6\u00bc but there are a few rare birds \u2013 usually found in the porn industry \u2013 that can reach such lengths. I began to find it all very unlikely when you said your girlfriend not only complained and disparaged you in private but made fun of you in front of friends.", "Darlin\u2019, if any girl was that stoopid she\u2019d be so at her own peril; the chances are half her circle would as one cry \u201cYou don\u2019t like it? Hand him over!\u201d In my experience, far more women say they like a large one than protest they don\u2019t. Laughing at you would be the last thing on their minds, and while I do acknowledge that men with large penises find it ain\u2019t all as peachy in the bedroom as those with small ones think, they rarely complain about the show it makes. But you ruined it all by claiming yours has grown since your girlfriend has gone.", "No, penises cannot and do not grow in length after adolescence. They expand as the genitals develop during puberty but that\u2019s it; what you have when you finish growing, sometime during the teenage years, is what you stay with. Sadly, some kids still believe masturbating has something to do with it, because body development coincides with an increased interest in sex and with an increased incidence of self pleasuring. A young lad notices his penis expands as he rubs it and around the same time he sees it gain heft and weight, and often puts 2 and 2 together and gets 5. There is a link but it\u2019s not that wanking makes you grow (except temporarily!). It doesn\u2019t, during adolescence or at any other time.", "It\u2019s also very common for young men going through the hormonal and emotional upheavals of adolescence  to get frequent and uncontrolled erections but less so for adults to get this. If this was happening to an adult I\u2019d suggest speaking with a doctor to see if it has an emotional cause \u2013 grief, depression, obsession \u2013 or a physical cause. If this was a young man talking I\u2019d suggest he does what most learn to do \u2013 carry school cases in front of them to hide their arousal and to wear looser trousers rather than skin tight ones, if they don\u2019t want to be seen getting excited. Most people are tolerant of kids getting hair-triggered but would be less so of a grown man, feeling he was putting on a deliberate exhibition. As he would be, if he stood in trains with his crotch in women\u2019s faces wearing tight trousers knowing this was a tendency.", "Methinks you protest too much.", "But in most cases of excessive masturbation in adults the reasons are emotional rather than physical \u2013 fear of commitment, inability to make relationships, anxiety after a bad break up. For genuine cases of this, I\u2019d recommend talking to a counsellor and getting whatever was worrying you sorted out.", "As for what constitutes excessive and how often people \u201cshould\u201d masturbate; it\u2019s a piece of string. Some men and women are happy to masturbate twice a day or more often and are quite content about it. Teens particularly go at it with a will why not. Others feel the same about once a month. There\u2019s a problem if your masturbation comes first \u2013 if it affects your life, working or social, and is a refuge from real relationships rather than being a pleasant addition to your life. And as for penis size and women \u2013 well, the vagina can expand to take a baby\u2019s head. You think you that big?", "And penetrative sex isn\u2019t the be all and end all of sex. Some women prefer their partners to do deep penetration and like a large penis; other prefer just having the tip in and like small ones. There are no rules. And men often prefer to wear women\u2019s pants without it meaning they are transvestite. But not recognising that behaviour such as masturbating into a stash of women\u2019s knickers while looking through a stack of porn magazines might be hurtful to a regular girlfriend might display a tadge lack of empathy and understanding. All in all, I\u2019d suggest you would benefit from a talk with a counsellor to get your feelings and your behaviour understood and under your own control, or to sort out what might be appropriate to you age and situation.

But neither does lackadaisical, laissez faire parenting.

I have a daughter who is nearly 13.  My ex husband lived close by when we first split up, he then met a new partner who had a 7 year old daughter, they moved about 30 miles away from us back in 2003, and he didn\u2019t tell my daughter where he was gone, I only found out through his mum, who I am still close to, since then they have had two children, boys, my daugter has met one of them, and back in November 2003 my ex turned up one day saying he wanted to see my daughter, he did, promised her the earth, and then he hasn\u2019t been in contact with her since then.  She keeps going through periods where she is distraught by this, I just don\u2019t know what to do or where to go.  She is really down about not knowing where he is and why he isn\u2019t in touch with her, I am worried about her, she keeps sayiing that she feels like one part of her is gone, so she keeps pushing me away, because she doesn\u2019t trust anyone.  What can I do to help Susie?  I am at my wits end, she says she\u2019ll never be able to get on with her life.

I addition, many do find leaving their children painful for themselves. But instead of facing up to this pain, they run away from it.

But leaving her felt so awful he decided he\u2019s feel better if he avoided it all together. What I bet he didn\u2019t even think about was what she felt, or what sense she would make of it all.", "What I suggest is this. For a start, have an honest talk with your daughter about why her Dad left and why he now stays away.

Because left unchecked they are going to poison this relationship and make that poor child, who didn\u2019t ask to be in this situation, very unhappy. I\u2019m afraid you are the one who is going to have to change. His son was there before you and is going to remain there. Your boyfriend is his father, and is responsible for his well being. He loves him and so he should; he can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t change that. ", "And I suspect your hatred of her, and her in the boy, has increased with your involvement with him, and your fear that the link with is ex somehow take something away from you.

I strongly urge you to take the opportunity to talk these feelings out with someone like myself, who can let you pour them out and dump them where they may do no harm.

I have helped her practically, intellectually and emotionally. I have even turned a blind eye when I found out she had made a pass to my husband (when her marriage had broken down). In fact our relationship seems one way, where whenever I needed help \u2013 I have found her in more need than myself.  But now I have got to a stage that I think that I really can\u2019t help her \u2013 and I have realised that I am not prepared to help her or be there for her if she is not prepared to help herself.

One is practicality and cost; I could really only work in the way I  did on the Stepfamilies programme with a tv company behind me. I spent something like 30 hours in a very short, very intense period, with each family \u2013 a long weekend to begin with, another a fortnight later, and then a day to finish a fortnight after that (in some families I also had an extra day somewhere during the process). We\u2019re talking travel costs, B&B costs as well as my own time. And the issue is for it to work in such a short and overwhelming period, everyone in the family has to be on board.

When I did my training, it was a running joke that most of us took our new found skills and ideas home and practised them on our own families and either came back energised, or came back in tatters! In a sense, you have two choices when you get involved in such a profession; you walk the talk and take the consequences, or you separate work and personal life and refuse to see the join. Me \u2013 I took the stuff home and while it caused mayhem at first, it made me and my family immeasurably better.

And you take responsibility for yourself, but not for others; that\u2019s their business.", "I can\u2019t comment on your sister and her family, your sister and her professional skills, your sister and her own needs. I can comment on your responsibilities and needs and boundaries. Like all siblings, you  have grown up with a flexible idea of the boundary between you \u2013 and I note, boundaries and their being broken would have been a big issue in your family. She is older than you but you seem to feel you should look after her, or are beholden to her. Because she took the brunt of the abuse and protected you and you feel, or were told by her, you owe her? ", "She probably went into her profession looking for the healing and control she needed as a result of her childhood experiences. Maybe she found it, maybe she didn\u2019t. But in a sense, you have always given her a reason NOT to look for a new relationship with you because you have always taken the position of the one to take control, take the responsibility between you. Lending her money and not getting it back is very kind. It\u2019s also very controlling and very disenabling \u2013 she has no incentive to grow up and take the reins herself from you because you endlessly give her the opportunity not to need to. ", "You may feel she needs counselling herself. I may agree. But unless she agrees, nothing is going to happen. But as long as you function as her safety net, she never needs to. My advice would be to tell her you love her unconditionally, but that you are going to stop supporting her unconditionally \u2013 and thus actually holding her back in holding her up. No more money, no more support except to say \u201cSeek professional help.\u201d As I said, sensible counsellors walk the talk \u2013 we\u2019re not afraid to say when we need support and seek it and we don\u2019t see needing outside support a reflection on our skills. On the contrary, it\u2019s an assertion of the need and the value of such help. I have, I do. ", "One  last thing you can do for her is buy her my book Stepfamilies \u2013 surviving and thriving in a new family (pub Simon and Schuster \u2013 see the books page on this site). Give it to her saying you feel it might help\u2026and then leave her alone except for giving her sisterly love and sisterly company.

Ask them to nominate traditions they particularly like \u2013 stockings in bed or round the breakfast table, presents all in one orgy of opening, or spread throughout the day. Discuss what might belong to the past but not be quite as helpful and see if you can all agree on a weekend in which everyone gets something of what they like.

Bad behaviour is a way of showing we have bad feelings \u2013 pain, fear, anxiety, anger. Children should have their needs for love, security, approval met.

Put a bright spin on it \u2013 point out this way, you\u2019ll be glad to see them and have lots to talk about. Tell her that from now on you don\u2019t want her to ring otherwise or call round unless it\u2019s an emergency.

If she rings again, ignore it. Ignored calls are only stressful when you feel you have to answer in case there is a problem. When you know there is not, you can turn your back. If she really does go on calling, pick up the phone, firmly say \u201cI\u2019m not speaking now Mum \u2013 bye.\u201d and put it down.", "And keep it up.

The mistake so many parents make in that situation is to think the few minutes peace you get if you give in is worth it. It isn\u2019t because the child knows they\u2019ve got you trained \u2013 every time they want sweets they just need to squall. Same thing; your mother knows from past experience all she has to do is keep up the pressure and you\u2019ll give her what she wants. SO STOP DOING IT.", "Very important!!! Do NOT make excuses or give reasons other than that you aren\u2019t going to talk. If you say you\u2019re busy or whatever, she\u2019ll think she can go on ringing until you are free. The point you\u2019re getting across is that you love her but are not at her back and call\u2026and that\u2019s that. ", "Think of it as practise for when you are a mother. Sometimes, we have to draw boundaries and keep to them, however hard it feels and however much the child (or parent!) objects. And that sometimes, we can\u2019t keep everyone happy. In the long run, your Mum will be better off if she learns now to modify her behaviour. Because if she doesn\u2019t I can see a time in the future when your husband says \u201cIt\u2019s her or me\u201d or when you simply blow up and tell her you\u2019re fed up of it.

And perhaps they do want to get on and share fun that fits an older child while your parents are content to go at the pace of the youngest; your older son may not be as keen on that as you and your parents are! ", "But you may have hit the nail on the head about their reasons for concentring on your eldest. There are often also great disparities between what different adults can manage. Your in-laws have had experience of being with a single child \u2013 and only children are often far more adult than their years. They had him as a small one for 2 or 3 years \u2013 you have more than 5 years experience now of dealing with little ones.  It could be that they actually feel  overwhelmed and inadequate at looking after a very young child, unlike your own parents who may have more competence and confidence. ", "I think you could sit down and talk with your in-laws. But do it in the spirit of sharing impressions rather than as an attack or a complaint. If they can reflect and discuss what it is about seeing one of your sons and not both \u2018fits\u2019 with them, perhaps they can manage to change. Say your younger son would like to have some time with them too but say you can understand if, at present, they don\u2019t feel confident with both children. Ask if there is anything you can do to help. It really isn\u2019t uncommon for grandparents to suddenly come into their own when kids get to whatever age they feel most comfortable dealing with.

Many transvestite men dress up and have sex with women partner\u2019s not men.", "Men who have sex with men often claim they are not gay and I can see what they might be saying. The issue is that in this society we seem to assume sexual behaviour is a one-way door \u2013 you\u2019re either on one side or the other and once through you can\u2019t go back. But plenty of people slide up and down on a continuum of sexual behaviour. Some people are only and ever straight. Some are bisexual. Some are only and ever gay. Most are mainly gay or mainly straight in varying degrees. So you can experiment with one sex while still reserving most of your sexual attraction to the other.  ", "What I do think you need to consider, seriously, is this. That having a gay fling or experiment while calling yourself straight is still being unfaithful. If your girlfriend did the same \u2013 or had a little sexual moment with that hunk from the rugby club \u2013 would dressing it up in some apparently trivialising description somehow make it any the less hurtful or a betrayal? And having a one-off, non-serious dabble doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re protected from catching a sexual infection. It\u2019s amazing how many people think by downplaying the event you\u2019re downplaying the consequences. If you want to dress up, fine. It\u2019s a fairly common desire and you\u2019ve no need to box yourself in because of it. But what you do is more important than the terms you use to describe it.

I\u2019m a 23 year old guy who has often had homosexual fantasies.  One night a few months ago, I decided to act on them and it was a disaster.

There\u2019s a girl I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with and it\u2019s possible she may like me too.  The thing is, by having this homosexual encounter it feels like I\u2019ve forfieted my chance of being with her and it\u2019s depressing me even more.

You don\u2019t go though the section marked \u201chomosexual\u201d and find it\u2019s one-way and you can\u2019t go back. Millions of people pop back and forth over that line, being attracted to someone of the opposite sex one day and someone of their own sex the next. Sexual orientation isn\u2019t an either/or, one thing or the other issue. They best way I\u2019ve heard it defined is to imagine a line. At one end are people who are only ever attracted to people of their own sex. At the other end are people who are only ever attracted to people of the opposite sex. In the middle are true bisexuals \u2013 people who really don\u2019t notice the sex of those they are attracted to because it simply isn\u2019t relevant to them. Along the line on either side of bisexuals are those who mostly are gay or mostly are straight but may be attracted and may act on their attraction to people of the other sexuality now and again. Notice one thing; if you accept that theory \u2013 and I do \u2013 it means people who are totally gay and people who are totally straight are actually in the minority. Most people are somewhere on the line.", "Which is why \u2013 second thing to get straight \u2013 gay sexual fantasies are so common. Most people have them. Having a particular sexual fantasy \u2013 gay sex, rough sex, sex in front of an audience to name a few very, very common ones \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean you want to carry that particular action out in real life. The point about a sexual fantasy is that it\u2019s safe and inside your head. It can be a rehearsal for the real thing but more often it\u2019s simply a dabble in the forbidden. ", "You may be gay and what is stopping you express your self is the brainwashing so may people receive that makes them ashamed of their true inclinations. You may be straight and fell for the mistaken impression that just because you dreamed it you had to do it. Or you may be where most people are \u2013 somewhere on that line and capable  of feeling and expressing desire for various people regardless of their gender. Whatever, it really isn\u2019t something to get so upset about and certainly not something you feel \u2018dooms\u2019 you for the future.", "My advice? Lighten up.

I was with my partner for 6 years. We are about the same age and had a lot in common. About 1 year ago he walked out \u2013 not in an aggressive way, but to go home to Spain to try to pursue a career. I was initially too much in shock to point out that it was a bit more complicated than just leaving like that\u2026. we had a mortgage together, in his name, and I had moved to a small town (at his choice) and when my mother died, moved my father (86 and wonderful) to live very near us (I bought a flat for him with a mortgage). Shortly after he left I realised I couldn\u2019t cope financially, so I applied for the only well-paid job I could find. Alas, this was in France\u2026.

At the end of the year, we finally got the financial things sorted \u2013 but at a huge cost to me. And I started trying to be friendly, nothing else \u2013 to keep the door open I guess. Then I got sick. He made a lot of noise about being supportive, coming to England a few times to see me. Now, I would like his help and support in dismantling our life here.

The evidence suggests what makes you gay is a complex mix of genetics \u2013 but no one gay gene \u2013 and multifactorial environmental issues. ", "But far more important than that is the fact that being gay simply isn\u2019t that much of a deal anymore. Oh yes, maybe in your GPs day male gay sexual acts were illegal so being gay was fraught. If found out you could be hounded to death and homophobia was a real and frightening aspect of daily living. \u201cGay\u201d is now a casual term of opprobrium in schools and many young people can be hideous about it. But times have changed so much. Laws against all discrimination mean workplace and higher education discrimination is rare and to be frank, it can be cool to be gay. As you say, he has four best friends who are fine about it and I bet it\u2019s not an issue in his school and won\u2019t be at uni or in work. So this \u201cit\u2019s going to be a hard path\u201d is nonsense. ", "And changes in society also mean the two big losses that parents of gay people faced may no longer be out of reach \u2013 a wedding and a family. Most mums particularly mourn the idea of never watching their son or daughter plight their troth in an extravagant celebration where you get to wear the Mother of the bride or groom gear. Well \u2013 update! Now, you can. And that moment when you holds your son or daughter\u2019s baby \u2013 also, update! Now, you can and not an adopted child, a child of their blood. Let\u2019s face it, your straight son or daughter may not keep to the script either but the point is that whatever the sexual orientation of your child, you now have equal chance of having those fantasies fulfilled.", "This \u201cjust a phase\u201d thing is something I think from our 50 years ago. Somewhere along the line it entered into the collective consciousness, along with the idea that the testimony of women and children was not to be trusted (we can thank Freud for the latter and I suspect the former too!) It\u2019s a total misunderstanding of the facts. Yes, teenagers do thrash around exploring and experimenting, trying to sort out who they are and where they stand. And yes, the teenage years are the ones in which sexuality among many aspects are focused on and explored and so their sexual orientation may come up, and out, at this time. And yes, some young people explore orientation and draw back from expressing gay feelings. But not necessarily because \u201cit\u2019s a phase\u201d. ", "What I know happened in my day was that gay men and women might have tried or started to come out and realised that their parents, friends and society at large would make life so ghastly the best thing was to go back in the closet. Their orientation wasn\u2019t changed; their behaviour was. And that\u2019s where you get the families in which a Mum or a Dad finally snaps after years of marriage and having kids to either have a gay affair, or actually come out and leave a family they\u2019ve been struggling to stay in for years. If, that is, they make it that far. Suicide is also an option for people who go back in the closet having peeped out and been convinced they better accept it\u2019s \u201cjust a phase\u201d.", "You\u2019ve \u2018had your suspicions\u2019 for some time. Of course you have, as had he. Most gay men and women will say they first became aware they had feelings for their own sex over feelings for the opposite sex in primary school. Optimum age seems to be about 9 \u2013 it can be younger. By the time they are teenagers, they are usually pretty certain. As, frequently, are friends and family, although they may be in denial.", "I do also have to say that sexuality and sexual orientation is also a very complex and shifting issue. To my mind, and to many others, sexual orientation isn\u2019t a clearcut on/off, straight/gay thing. Think of it as a continuum. At one end of the continuum are the men and women who will only ever be attracted to members of their own sex. At the other end, the men and women who will only ever be attracted to members of the other sex. And then there are the great majority strung along the line. In the middle, true bisexuals who swing both ways, straight or gay 50% of the time. Some men and women will be solidly one or the other but capable of at least being attracted to their own or the other sex. Some will be less fixed. ", "Now \u2013 that seems to contradict my stricture about it\u2019s NOT a phase. Because yes, he may sometime down the line find himself attracted to a woman, IF he\u2019s actually nearer the middle than towards the end point. But I wouldn\u2019t count on it and I think it\u2019s really important for you to recognise it\u2019s not about choice and it\u2019s not about your influencing it. And, of course, it\u2019s not about where you are on that line as being \u2018better\u2019 or more desirable than being in another place. ", "So \u2013 where does that put you? You can\u2019t give him \u2018wrong advice\u2019. Nothing you say or do is going to affect his sexual orientation. The only thing \u2013 THE ONLY THING \u2013 you can affect is how he feels about himself, how he feels about you and telling you, how he is supported in telling the other members of his family. So far, you\u2019re doing fine. But you needs to stop seeing this as about you. You didn\u2019t \u2018make him gay\u2019. You can\u2019t \u2018unmake\u2019 him gay. What he needs from you is simple acceptance. He\u2019s your son \u2013 same as he ever was. He needs your love and approval, same as he ever did. That\u2019s all.", "What you needs is some support to go on supporting him. There is a very good group for parents of gay and lesbian young  people called ", " ", "It\u2019s really good; it offers local groups and contacts and also speaks out and acts to defend and enhance the human and civil rights of lesbians, gays and bisexuals. ", "You do have to grasp the nettle soon about his Dad, and his brother. There is some evidence to suggest gayness runs in families \u2013 it\u2019s one of the aspects that supports the gay gene argument but as I said, that\u2019s complex and multifactorial and the jury is still out on the details. But the evidence suggests if you have one child who is gay the chances of another being gay is enhanced.  ", "But, if Mums find it hard to let go of their fantasies about their children and facing up to the new reality of their child, dads have it too \u2013 and in spades about a son. Mums will struggle with the \u201cIs this my fault, what did I do or not do?\u201d Dads will too. Both may also have a horrible thought; \u201cWhat does this say about my own sexuality??\u201d And if it\u2019s a son, Dads may well go into frantic, furious denial of a violent sort to push that idea away. And of course, a non resident Dad may have even more reason to feel guilty, scared and thus to need scapegoats and to attack even more. His brother may feel the same \u2013 need to push him away to \u2018preserve\u2019 himself. Or not \u2013 he may actually be the one in the family to show most support; who knows? ", "My feeling is that keeping it a hidden secret does several, very harmful things. It says you\u2019re ashamed of your son and who he is. It means when it does come out \u2013 and believe me, it will \u2013 those kept in the dark not only have to contend with the revealed secret but that you kept it from them. they may feel insulted you didn\u2019t trust them, humiliated other people knew first \u2013 all sorts of conflicting and difficult feelings which will only serve to muddy the waters and make it harder to concentrate on the real issue.", "And most important, it will deny them the opportunity to know your son as he is, and to have a relationship with the real him based on love, trust and truth. That\u2019s what most people kept out of the loop often say hurt them most. Yes, maybe they may have reacted badly and unhelpfully, but they weren\u2019t given the chance to grow and come up to expectations. ", "I\u2019d strongly suggest you visit FFLAG for help and support for yourself, and in telling his Dad, and his brother. I think they will help you come to terms with the new reality and not to see it as an automatic sentence of hard labour and pain. Mind you \u2013 FFLAG do have some pretty awful tales to tell. But it\u2019s not as your GP says or necessarily as their worst case scenarios say anymore. And many of their stories are so inspirational and reassuring! The key is that we all have to pull together to fight discrimination and the fight begins in our own hearts and the hearts of those around us. Good luck!"]},

Depends what you mean by wrong, I suppose. I mean, look at yourself and your family. You\u2019re worrying enough to make yourself ill. Both brothers have chosen to marry someone who cheats on them, one with her own father in law. Your father is prepared to cheat on his own son. And you don\u2019t get on well with your own mother.

", "Your father is cheating and it makes you miserable \u2013 you\u2019re carrying secrets that no young person should have to keep. Your relationship with your mother has been compromised. That may be because she\u2019s miserable with the man she should love and be loved by and she\u2019s angry to see you blindly worshipping him. And what about your brothers? I suspect what influenced them to go into their marriages are their experiences with your parents, particularly their father \u2013 not very happy ones, by the sound of it. ", "So what can you do? It\u2019s not your responsibility to repair your parents relationship or to look after them \u2013 they should be doing the repair and the caring.  No, I don\u2019t think you should tell your Mum about his cheating. I think you should tell him. ", "In your position I would tell him what a lousy example he\u2019s giving, how miserable it\u2019s making you, how sad it probably made your brothers and how awful it clearly makes your mother feel, and how destructive the whole thing is to the family and each individual in it; him included. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not for me to know the whys and wherefores of why he does it but that as his daughter I \u2018d like to think it was about time he grew up and acted like a parent and an adult in getting his act together.

Judging from the letters I receive, coming out is rarely easy and rarely early.", "Most gay men and women keep schtum about their sexuality for years after realising their own feelings. But sooner or later the stress of keeping it secret, the pain of living a lie and the sheer hassle of fending off the inevitable \u201cAnd when are you going to bring home a nice girl/boy?\u201d gets too much. Coming out to friends and colleagues may be hard enough but the people you most want to tell, and most dread facing, are always your family.", "Late teens seems a common time to come clean, when parents and other relatives start making comments and asking questions. But fears and anxieties about what may result from disclosure often mean people keep quiet into their twenties and thirties or even longer. If asked why they remain silent, most explain is as harm reduction; if I came out, they would kill me, or it would kill them.", "Some carry the secret into marriage, though parenthood and even into grandparenthood. While adolescence is a peak time for coming out, your own children\u2019s adolescence is another. Not just because their emerging sexuality forces you to confront your own but because this life event often coincides with another; your own parents\u2019 deaths. Once you no longer have to confess to Mum and Dad, quite a few people find the strength to be true to themselves.", "It would be a pity to leave it that long. The main drawback of not coming out is what you all lose. You deprive your family of the chance to know the real you. You deprive yourself of the chance to be the real you, in and outside your family. And you rob them of the opportunity to rise to a challenge by assuming, without trying, that they\u2019d fail the test. Parents are often shocked when a son or daughter comes out to them, but they are frequently not surprised. Just as most people know they are gay from an early age, their nearest and dearest usually realise it, too. ", "The key to coming out with maximum support and minimum pain is down to timing and how you do it. After all, if you want respect, you have to give it. If you want your parents to accept and love you for who you are, you need to tell them about your sexuality because you want to share yourself and be yourself, not as an act of revenge or spite. They may have done plenty to provoke your anger and bitterness, but the way round that is to show them how to behave by not attacking.", "Talk first to someone you know will help, such as a counsellor on Lesbian and Gay Switchboard (www.llgs.org.uk). Practise with them how to come out to someone close to you, such as a friend, who can be your safety net. ", "Before you tackle your parents, put yourself in their shoes. What might your coming out mean to them? For many people, it raises terrible anxieties about their own sexuality. Parents may mourn the loss, as they see it, of their future, imagining this will mean no grandchildren from you. It might lead to resentful feelings from siblings, with the burden of providing grandchildren all on their shoulders. But what most parents fear when a child comes out is blame. They wonder \u201cWhat have I done wrong that my child is gay?\u201d or, more realistically, \u201cHow did I fail you, leaving you to cope with this on your own?\u201d", "It\u2019s fear that makes people hit out. If you understand that, you can at least forgive and give them the chance to get over it. What you want and need from your family is their approval, acceptance and unconditional love. The best way of getting it is to offer it. However hostile, tearful, scared they may be, first reactions are not the last. Parents who scream, cry and act as if you\u2019ve disclosed a terminal illness may turn out to be the ones who end up shrugging, killing the fatted calf for your partner\u2019s visit and attending Mardi Gras.", "As an agony aunt I have plenty of reason to be deeply sceptical about human behaviour; I\u2019d never underestimate people\u2019s capacity for vicious, mean-spirited bigotry, hypocrisy and prejudice. But I\u2019d also never underestimate the ability to learn, to grow, to love. It\u2019s surprising how often they start off pontificating against \u201cthem\u201d, rethink when it\u2019s \u201cOur Charlie\u201d and end up realising their fears were nonsense.", "In the end, the consensus seems to be that telling is worth the pain and the hassle. Your family and friends may turn out to be ones to let themselves down by  not rising to the occasion. They may descend into fruitless recrimination and reject you. If they do, it\u2019s their loss, their problem and their responsibility, not yours. But if that\u2019s the worst scenario of telling, consider the fact that the worst scenario of not telling is almost as bad; having to spend the rest of your life lying, deceiving and being ashamed of simply being yourself.

It\u2019s one of the reasons I have little respect for some religions; their strictures on sexuality and sexual expression are cruel, stupid, mindlessly out of date and have no connection to real people and real lives.

Our feelings grew stronger for each other over the last three and last year both of us finished relationships and he asked me out. Everything was wonderful, we had so much in common. We kept it secret for a little while but when it came out, a lot of people said they couldn\u2019t understand what took us so long. We talked about marriage and he said he knew where and when he would propose and gave me his word we would marry this year, after his birthday."], "advice": ["We had a wonderful holiday together and when we came back, it all went wrong. He said he wasn\u2019t ready, the year rushed by so fast and he didn\u2019t think he loved me as he should if he was going to marry me. Now, when we\u2019re together it\u2019s as good as ever but he feels he messed it up and has got to fix it but he doesn\u2019t know how. I\u2019m even prepared to live with him. I\u2019ve thought about Relate but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go.", "People who have been let down in childhood sometimes find commitment scary. It\u2019s as if they feel that whenever they trust and love someone, that\u2019s the time when it all goes wrong. As long as relationship is tentative, they feel fine but when marriage and children loom, they feel driven to be the one to call a halt, before they can be abandoned once more. That could be one reason for his behaviour.", "If he\u2019s never really experienced unconditional love and warmth, another could be that he has unrealistically high expectations of love. He thinks he should be in a state of bliss full-time, and since life isn\u2019t like that he feels cheated. Going to Relate would really help because a counsellor would help the two of you understand what you wanted, expected and needed out of this relationship and help you see if it\u2019s the relationship that has let you down or your beliefs.  Make an appointment for both of you and if he\u2019s reluctant to go at first, take heart because he\u2019ll probably join you later if you go along on your own."]},
{"category": ["All Advice", "Relationships"], "title": ["Parking Problems"], "problem": ["I\u2019m driven to distraction by inconsiderate neighbours. Since moving here 13 years ago we\u2019ve had 3 new neighbours in the house across the road, whose gate is more or less facing ours. Visitors always leave their car opposite our gate making it difficult, but not impossible, to get out. The previous people left their car on the road from day 1.  We all have garages and drives so there\u2019s no excuse. I very politely asked them to move and the man was apologetic, the woman never spoke to me again and obviously thought I was a Moaning Minny. Now the newcomers are doing the same. Should I play them at their own game? I don\u2019t want to seem petty but I get so worked up and then depressed. I don\u2019t feel inclined to ask them especially if they get nasty and do it all the more. My husband doesn\u2019t see my point and he doesn\u2019t want to move after all this time."], "advice": ["  ", "\u00a0", "Have you asked yourself why it upsets you so much? As you admit, your exit isn\u2019t actually being blocked. Whether we realise it or not, we\u2019re just like other members of the animal kingdom in being very territorial. We feel threatened when a stranger comes onto \u201cour\" patch. This makes us feel scared and angry, which is why you feel so upset at what, on the surface, seems a slight offence.  Parking on the road yourself is going to have no effect at all if they share your husband\u2019s laid-back attitude and is only going to lead to a row if they share yours. ", "Your best bet is to face up to being a bit OTT in your feelings. Go to them and confess that you know you\u2019re being silly but would they do you a favour and leave your exit well clear. You may find that if you make friends, their car parking won\u2019t upset you because you won\u2019t see them as threatening your terrain.    "]},

There\u2019s a man at work I like very much. His marriage failed and he was treated badly by his ex so I think he feels all women are no good. I must come across as the flirty type that would cheat on him and not be serious. I wish I could show my more sensitive side to him. I see him every day and he does know I like him but he\u2019s got the wrong impression of me."], "advice": ["You don\u2019t know what he thinks of you until you ask. He may not be chatting you up or asking you out simply because he wants to keep his work and social life separate, not because he has a poor opinion of you or of women in general. If you\u2019re really keen, test the water. Ask him directly if he\u2019d like to go out for a drink and get to know you. But if the real you is a bit of a joker, trying to pretend to be someone else won\u2019t make for a good relationship. Be yourself and you may find he likes your style after all."]},
{"category": ["All Advice", "Relationships"], "title": ["Lap Dancing"], "problem": ["A crowd of about six of us go out for a drink every Friday night. We\u2019ve got in the habit of going to a couple of lap dancing bars, which are a great laugh. A couple of the guys bring their girlfriends with them, who say it\u2019s fun and have no problem with this. Mine refuses. She\u2019s not a prude and normally she\u2019s great fun, so why is she being so unreasonable?"], "advice": ["I wonder how you would feel if the positions were reversed. If, every Friday night, your girlfriend and five of her friends toured bars in which semi-naked men danced on tables and between their legs, begging for tips and gyrating lasciviously for their attention? Think of the way you and your friends behave to each other, to the lap dancers and towards these girlfriends and then consider whether you\u2019d be happy or comfortable having the exact same behaviour turned on you.  ", "Of course, the analogy isn\u2019t perfect. There is a difference because men who strip for women are always more in control and less victims than women who strip for men. Women at a male strip show are far more on the edge \u2013 flirting with dominance but not really in control of it. Lap dancing and stripping are, in essence, male expressions of male supremacy \u2013 no more, no less. Male strippers are seen by men as an affront and a challenge, but the reality is you don\u2019t take that challenge terribly seriously and so it\u2019s one you can comfortably ignore and discount. ", "But your girlfriend can\u2019t ignore or discount your choice of Friday night entertainment because, much as you\u2019d like to play it down, it has a quite profound resonance for your relationship. What are the messages your girlfriend is getting from both what you like to do, and the fact that you can\u2019t hear her reaction?", "That you like looking at semi-naked women, which is perfectly natural and normal? More, surely, than that. That you see women as a commodity, to be paid to shake their booty for you. That you don\u2019t see sexual stimulation or display as something personal and private between her and you but just as legitimate in the company of other men and directed at an impersonal object. But, above all, that your pleasure is infinitely more important than her feelings.", "She doesn\u2019t like it and has the guts to say so, but your response is that there must be something wrong with her \u2013 Look, you say, other women are fine about it! Well, I doubt that. The problem is that many people find it hard to go against the pressure of their friends. Worse, a lot of women define themselves by having a boyfriend and will put up with all sorts of shit rather than throw the bastard over or get into conflict with him. And, alas, the accusation of being a prude or frigid or sexually bourgeois can still tie women in knots and have them doing all sorts against their own preference, rather than be seen by their men as spoiling the fun.", "It may be worth while just trying to analyse exactly what sort of pleasure you get from going to these bars. The pleasure of looking at a scantily clad women? (How old did you say you were?) The pleasure of having women apparently begging for your approval and approbation? (How needy can you be?) The joy of joining with men in a Man Thing (Oh perleaze, go run with the wolves and bang a drum in the woods!)", "I know this lap dancing thing is frightfully fash at this moment, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s either good or healthy. Like many women, your girlfriend probably finds it humiliating and degrading. She finds the interaction between the working women and your friends embarrassing. She feels your involvement is debasing to her, you and your relationship and perhaps to women in general.", "Arguments about the free choice of the women involved and the fact they earn the money cut no ice; what is important here is that she doesn\u2019t like it and has said no, and you can\u2019t or won\u2019t seem to listen to her point of view or take her \u201cNo\u201d as her last word. Which really, to be frank, is what her refusal is all about. Your pleasure, your rights, your point of view are all you seem to recognise; if it\u2019s good for you, that\u2019s fine.", "So go run with the boys and the 2 girls who are so scared of losing their boys they\u2019ll tag along. Maybe your woman will wait until you can hear her, listen to her and engage in an adult-to-adult discussion about this. And maybe she won\u2019t. "]}
